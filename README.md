Network &amp; Support files for various projects

In support of A Generalized Framework for Controlling FDR in Gene Regulatory Network Inference. http://dlvr.it/Qhmg5f and other projects during my Ph.D. -- which can be found at http://DanielCMorgan.com

Each project has a folder, within which can be found 1. Nested Bootstrap (NB) network files (.tsv) and 2. plot files (.dat) which then display as support curves
